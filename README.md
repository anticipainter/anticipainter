# Anticipainter

Try to paint every tile within the maze, but there's a twist...

You can only paint while the game has control!


The game takes control every few seconds â€“ try to anticipate what will happen so you're away from danger when you lose control.

Bumping into a white wall is harmless, but a red wall will end your game. Try to see if you can find a location where you will not die once the next sequence of moves is executed. Look at the sequence on the right side of the screen to strategically Anticipaint!

See how many tiles you can paint without dying! Our best so far is 74.
